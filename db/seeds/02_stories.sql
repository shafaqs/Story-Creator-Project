    2, 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears', 'Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own in a wood. One of them was a little, small wee bear; one was a middle-sized bear, and the other was a great, huge bear. One day, after they had made porridge for their breakfast, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling. And while they were walking, a little girl came into the house.

    7, 'The Cat Who Wanted to Be a Monkey', 'Once upon a time, Mother Bushcat, Father Bushcat, and Baby Bushcat were watching the monkey playing. They saw how he drank flower nectar, ate fruit, picked flees from his friends fur, and swung through the trees shrieking and chattering.

    1, 'The gods have a problem', 'Deep in a dark forest of India a holy man was hovering slightly off the ground, just above the carpet of leaves. This wise man, known in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit as a “rishi”, had once been a king, wealthy and powerful. In old age he went without food, company, and sleep. After depriving his body and focusing his mind for many years, he had achieved the power of levitation, and as he sat deep in a trance, his body rose into the air. He was not without an audience.', '2022-12-31');

    6, 'The Boy And The Filberts', 'A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry. "My boy," said his mother, "be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time." Do not attempt too much at once.', '2023-01-03', TRUE);

    4, 'The Mice', 'Mice live in our walls but do not trouble our kitchen. We are pleased but cannot understand why they do not come into our kitchen where we have traps set, as they come into the kitchens of our neighbors. Although we are pleased, we are also upset, because the mice behave as though there were something wrong with our kitchen. What makes this even more puzzling is that our house is much less tidy than the houses of our neighbors. There is more food lying about in our kitchen, more crumbs on the counters and filthy scraps of onion kicked against the base of the cabinets. In fact, there is so much loose food in the kitchen I can only think the mice themselves are defeated by it. In a tidy kitchen, it is a challenge for them to find enough food night after night to survive until spring. They patiently hunt and nibble hour after hour until they are satisfied. In our kitchen, however, they are faced with something so out of proportion to their experience that they cannot deal with it. They might venture out a few steps, but soon the overwhelming sights and smells drive them back into their holes, uncomfortable and embarrassed at not being able to scavenge as they should.', '2022-11-15', TRUE);

    8, 'The Outing', 'An outburst of anger near the road, a refusal to speak on the path, a silence in the pine woods, a silence across the old railroad bridge, an attempt to be friendly in the water, a refusal to end the argument on the flat stones, a cry of anger on the steep bank of dirt, a weeping among the bushes.', '2022-10-01', TRUE);
